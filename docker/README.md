This Dockerfile creates a slave that has all packages and R libs to create the usage statistics reports.
To be run on abibuilder3 (or any other machine with access to the docker registry).
For general testing, just replace the base container to an official Ubuntu image. E.g. ubuntu_1804 to ubuntu:18.04
